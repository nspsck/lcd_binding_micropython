## Introduction
This is a fork from Ibuque's lcd_binding_micropython specific for the RM67162 (Used in T-AMOLED S3). Original repo: [lcd_binding_micropython](https://github.com/lbuque/lcd_binding_micropython). 

This driver is based on [esp_lcd](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/lcd.html).

The performance has been increased by roughly 700% (only applies to the RM67162 driver). Now supports the newest Micropython using esp-idf v5.0.2.

- changed the program structure for more readability
- added brightness control
- fixed the initialization bug using tft_config.py
- Drawing functions: fill, fill_rect, rect, fill_cirlce, cirlce, pixel, line, vline, hline, colorRGB

To-DO:
- Fontsupport: bitmap fonts
- png support

## Documentation
In general, the screen starts at 0, and goes to 535 x 239, that's a total resolution of 536 x 240. All drawing functions should be called with this in mind.

- `init()`

  Must be called to initialize the display.

- `deinit()`

  Deinit the tft object and release the memory used for the framebuffer.

- `reset()`

  Soft reset the display.

- `rotation(value)`

  Rotate the display, value range: 0 - 3.

- `brightness(value)`

  Set the screen brightness, value range: 0 - 100, in percentage.

- `disp_off()`

  Turn off the display.

- `disp_on()`

  Turn on the display.

- `backlight_on()`

  Turn on backlight, this is equal to `brightness(100)`.

- `backlight_off()`

  Turn off backlight, this is equal to `brightness(0)`.

- `invert_color()`

  Invert the display color.

- `height()`

  Returns the height of the display.

- `width()`

  Returns the width of the display.

- `colorRGB(r, g, b)`

  Call this function to get the rgb color for the drawing.

- `pixel(x, y, color)`

  Draw a single pixel at the postion (x, y) with color.

- `hline(x, y, l, color)`

  Draw a horizontal line starting at the postion (x, y) with color and length l. 

- `vline(x, y, l, color)`

  Draw a vertical line starting at the postion (x, y) with color and length l.

- `fill(color)`

  Fill the entire screen with the color.

- `fill_rect(x, y, w, h, color)`

  Draw a rectangle starting from (x, y) with the width w and height h and fill it with the color.

- `rect(x, y, w, h, color)`

  Draw a rectangle starting from (x, y) with the width w and height h of the color.

- `fill_circle(x, y, r, color)`

  Draw a circle with the middle point (x, y) with the radius r and fill it with the color.

- `circle(x, y, r, color)`

  Draw a circle with the middle point (x, y) with the radius r of the color.

- `bitmap(x0, y0, x1, y1, buf)`

  Bitmap the content of a bytearray buf filled with color565 values starting from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1). Currently, the user is resposible for the provided buf content.
